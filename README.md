# Project 1: The Brochure Site

## Introduction

The "brochure site" is a rite of passage for all web developers. Back in the
late-nineties, when some of us got started writing HTML, brochure sites were all
there was. It was a lot of this: "Hi my name is Joe Flatiron and I'm a senior
in high school. I love [The Beatles][beatles] and the [Fugees][]. I'm on the
web!" Needless to say, things have gotten a lot prettier and a lot more
complicated since then!

In order to demonstrate to prospective employers, friends, family, poodles, and,
most importantly, _yourself_ how far you've come in your knowledge of HTML and
CSS you too must build a personal web site that integrates all that you've
learned over these previous weeks.

As a hint of what this exercise is worth in the marketplace, a cursory search
for "brochure site fee" shows that this work can be billed at $75-$250/hr. That
represents rates you can charge or money you can avoid paying. This is not a
bad skill to have in one's portfolio.

## Requirements

As you become more experienced, your clients' or your needs will be expressed
_declaratively_ versus _imperatively_. People will tell you "Bring me a turkey
sandwich" not "Go to the kitchen. Take out bread, two slices, cheese (preferably
Irish Cheddar), etc." Similarly, we will present to you these requirements
_declaratively_. You must meet these _human-oriented_ targets, the techniques
and code will be _up to you to resolve_.

1. Your site must use HTML5 semantic elements for collecting content e.g.
   `<header>` and `<aside>`
2. Your site must be created over a series of `git` commits. Use good `git`
   hygiene as you have been taught
3. Your HTML must pass validation
4. Your CSS must pass validation
5. Your site must use one of these layout: multicolumn with floats, `flexbox`,
or CSS grid
6. Your site must be optimized for _at least_ 2 viewports (a full-screen device
   as well as a mobile device of choice)
7. You must include _at least_ 3 images

These are baseline requirements. As your creativity calls for expansion of
these ideas, follow it.

## Not Specified

1. **The subject matter**. While we'd love for you to post a page about how
   great programming is, the creativity of the Web's possibility is why so many
   of us have made it our vocation. Here are a few starter ideas:
   - a (r&eacute;sum&eacute;-like) or a hobby page ("Why [Sachin Tendulkar][ST]
   is the Greatest Sportsman of 3 generations")
   - a music page ("My list of [Phish][] Recordings with Audio Samples"). This
   can be something that will open a promotion discussion or which establishes
   your _bona fides_
2. **The Number of pages**. The goal of web design is to serve the content. If
   multiple pages does this best, great. Google has become a multi-billion
   dollar company with the most deceptively simple landing page in history.
   Serve your page with user experience in mind.

## Optional Features

1. Deploy your site to web hosting
2. Buy a domain name and configure DNS so that your brochure site is reachable
   by name

## Inspiration

Graphic design encompasses a wide variety of visual aesthetics. You might
choose one style over another. Try looking at the works of Jan Tschichold,
Ettore Sottsass, Piet Zwart, László Moholy-Nagy, Josef Muller-Brockman, Henryk
Berlewi, Khoi Vinh. While, a decade ago, it was inconceivable or incredibly
time-intensive to print-styled pages on the web, we now have technology that
makes this possible. See if you can find ideas to make your page come to life!
